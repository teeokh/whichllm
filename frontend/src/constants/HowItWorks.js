export const description = "WhichLLM operates using an algorithm which takes into account the benchmarks which best measure an LLM's ability to perform a specific task. A final percentage score is used to rank each LLM against the others. Each usecase has been allocated a number of benchmarks which best test for an LLM's ability at that usecase."
