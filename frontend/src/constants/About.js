export const about = "WhichLLM was created by me, Terrell, a doctor turned programmer. With the growing popularity of large language models, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, information has become increasingly hard to find on the capabilities of these tools for specific usecases. Most users don't know what benchmark scores are, let alone using them to decide which LLM is best for them. That's where WhichLLM comes in, delivering users an easy to digest recommendation and breakdown of which LLM is best for them. As time goes on, and more models are released, this information will become important as ever."
