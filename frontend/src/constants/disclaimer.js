export const main_disclaimer = "Benchmark data does not reveal the whole performance of a model, and so recommendations should be used only as a guide, and in conjunction with personal experience to decide on the best LLM for your usecase. This is partially because AI companies sometimes train their models specifically to perform well on certain benchmarks, giving the perception of better performance numerically."

export const update_disclaimer = "Benchmark data can change as new models get released, and new testing is performed. To stay as up to date as possible, WhichLLM fetches live data from certain benchmarks for use in its recommendation algorithm. For benchmarks that can't be updated via live sources, a manual update to benchmark data is performed once a month"

export const missing_data_disclaimer = "Due to the rapid release of new models, some models have not been tested on certain benchmarks, making comparison with other models a bit trickier. However, aside from benchmark scores that are much larger or smaller than their counterparts for a given usecase, I believe it is fair to stick with using the average of scores as a judge for recommending based on performance. The algorithm discounts those benchmarks that would otherwise skew recommendations."
